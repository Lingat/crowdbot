sing to me
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow
Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool By making his world a little colder.
